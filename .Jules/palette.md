## 2026-01-30 - Accessible Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Buttons that use symbolic characters (e.g., '‹', '›') as their visual content are often ignored or misread by screen readers. Adding an `aria-label` provides a clear accessible name without changing the visual design.
**Action:** Always check for icon-only buttons or those using symbolic characters and ensure they have descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
